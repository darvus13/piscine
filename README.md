  <h1>42 Piscine</h1>
  <p>These are all the projects I've done for my piscine in 42 MÃ¡laga, they all have been graded by Moulinette. <b>Please do not copy</b>, enjoy the journey and try to get yourself through the amazing and challenging experience 42 brings to you and try to get as much knowledge as you can.</p>

  <h1>Advice</h1>
  <p>If I had to do the piscine again I would like someone to give me these advices. First of all, this doesn't mean you have to do everything I say here, it is just my recommendation. Anyway due to different skill level on pisciners, there are some that would reach C06 on the third week and some that won't ever reach C06,
   however you should only focus on yourself and learning.</p>

   <h3>First week</h3>
   <p>I would focus first week on taking as soon as possible C00 and C01, try to get out fast from Shell00, try to do Rush00 and validate Shell01 by that weekend.</p>

   <h3>Second week</h3>
   <p>Focus on reaching C06, if you can't, just learn something about "argc & argv", you will thank me friday.</p>

   <h3>Third week</h3>
   <p>Try to keep going, you will find useful things after C06 that will come up later in cursus, also don't forget you're still in the piscine.</p>

  <h3>Fourth week</h3>
  <p>Focus on what you've done poorly on the last exams. Stay hydrated and bring some food to your last exam.</p>

  <h1>Finally</h1>
  <p>Yes when it comes to the end you will be exhausted, with a lot of mixed feelings and of course with the feeling of knowing that you did everything you could and more. You only have to wait, don't desperate about not knowing instantly if you're in or not. If you don't get into 42, don't lose your hope, you can try one more time!
   Hope this is useful to someone out struggling with the piscine and slightly helpful to keep going on. Good luck!</p>
